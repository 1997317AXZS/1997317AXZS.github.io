Is the tree pictured a valid binary search tree? If not, rearrange the nodes, keeping the same
root element. <br />

Answer:<br />
No, the picture is not a valid binary search tree.<br />
First, we can list out all the elements from left to right as an array on the tree, which should be:<br />
{22, 44, 55, 66, 99, 88, 77}<br />
But as we know that in a binary search tree, the elements should be in ascending order from left
to right, the previous array is not in ascending order, the tree is not a valid binary search tree.
Now, we need to sort the elements in ascending order, and get the array:<br />
{22, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99}<br />
Then, put the elements back to the tree, and get the binary search tree like below.<br />
