### Workbook: Chapter 4 ----- Problem 4:
For the following problems, find the postfix notation form of the given infix expression.
3 + 1 * 9 

Process:
Char Profit (Output) Stack Method
3 3 print operand
+ 3 + operator pushed on stack.
1 3 1 + print operand
* 3 1 * + operator pushed on stack.
9 3 1 9 * + print operand
3 1 9 * +
Answer: 3 1 9 * +


### Workbook: Chapter 4 ----- Problem 27:
Evaluate the postfix notation.
2 4 9 * -
Process:
First, we need to separate the postfix notation into two parts, the numbers 2, 4, 9 , and the math
symbols *, -. Then we can put the symbols from left to right, between the numbers from right to
left, and get the infix notation like this:
2 - 4 * 9.
It is not hard to calculate this, which is
2 - 4 * 9 = 2 - 36 = -34.
Answer: -

### Workbook: Chapter 9 ----- Problem 7:
Insert the following value into the binary search tree. Redraw the tree for each of the values.
A = {51, 36, 1, 43, 87, 52, 83} 

Process:
Step 1: We pick the first element on the first as the starting point, which is 53.

Step 2: We pick the second element 36, compare with 51, which is less than 51, it should be on
the left side, on the second floor.

Step 3: We pick the third element 1, which is less than 51, it should be on the left side of 51. But
36 is also on the left side of 51, we need to compare with 1 and 36. Because 1 is less than 36, it
should be on the left side of 36, and stay on the third floor.

Step 4: We pick the fourth element 43, which is smaller than 51, it should be on the left side of
51. Then, we compare it with 36, and it is larger than 36. So, 43 should be on the right side of
36 on the third floor.

Step 5: We pick the fifth element 87, which is larger than 51, and it should be on the right side of
51 on the second floor.

Step 6: We pick the sixth element 52, which is larger than 51. Then we compare it with 87, and
it is less than 87. So, 52 should be on the right side of 87 on the third floor.

Step 7: Finally, we pick the element 83, which is bigger than 51. Then, we compare it with 87,
and it is less than 87. So, we need to compare it with 52, too. Because, it is bigger than 52, it
should be on the right side of 52 on the fourth floor.
