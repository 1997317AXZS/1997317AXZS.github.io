### Workbook: Chapter 1 ----- Problem 8:
For the following formula f(n) = 3n+1, as n increases from 1 to 10, what is the resulting output?
Write the number as a series. 

Process: [WorkbookChapter1Problem8.java](WorkbookChapter1Problem8.java) 

Answer:
When n goes from 1 to 10, f(n) = 3n+1 should have the result on this:
[4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31]

### Workbook: Chapter 1 ---- Problem 15:
Rank these functions according to their growth, from the most expensive to the least expensive.
n n^3 1 (3/2)n n^2 2n log2(n) 

Process: [WorkbookChapter1Problem15.java](WorkbookChapter1Problem15.java) 

Answer:<br />
If n is a positive number:<br />
[n^3, n^2, 2n, (3/2) * n, n, log2(n), 1]<br />
If n is a 0:<br />
[1, n, (3/2)n, 2n, n^2, n^3, log2(n)]<br />
If n is a negative number:<br />
[n^2, 1, n, (3/2) * n, 2n, n^3, log2(n)]
