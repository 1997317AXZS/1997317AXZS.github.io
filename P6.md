### Workbook: Chapter 10 ----- Problem 21: 
Is this binary tree a valid max heap? Why or why not? <br />
[image](10_12_1.png) 

Answer: No, this is not a valid max heap. 

Reason:<br />
We all know that as a max heap, the parent node should be always equal or bigger than either
of its children nodes. Then, we can check all the nodes as parent nodes. <br />
When 12 is a parent node, it’s children nodes are 17 and 7. Right here, we see that 12 is less
than one of its child 17. So, we can conclude that this is not a valid max heap.

### Workbook: Chapter 9 ----- Problem 5:
Remove the value ‘43’ from the binary tree pictured. What is the new tree? <br />

Answer:<br />
From the picture, we can clearly see that there’s no child node for the node “43”. This means we
can only remove the node “43” without doing anything else to get a new tree like below:<br />

### Workbook: Chapter 9 ----- Problem 8:
Find the minimum and maximum value in the Binary Search Tree structure pictured. Mark the
node that is the minimum value and the node that is the maximum value. <br />

Answer:<br />
Because we know that this is a Binary Search Tree, the values from left to right (no matter in
which floor) should be from the smallest to the greatest. So, in this picture, the minimum should
be the leftmost node on the fourth floor. And the maximum value should be the rightmost node
on the fourth floor. The picture should be like this:<br />
